V.1.0 - The Big Reveal
A whole host of big changes have happened, deeming NerdBot officially
in its 1.0 status! Let's take a look at them.
- Redesigned changelog messages. All shiny and formatted.
- Updated the crate/clam spawning. Smoother separation of server spawns and a timer, so they don't spawn too often.
  Completely spam-proof.
- Begun storing data specific to a guild (server) separate from within the code, so it carries across bot restarts.
- Clam messages now update like crates do, when clams are claimed. They also have their own score!
